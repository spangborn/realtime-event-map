# realtime-event-map
NodeJS-powered real-time event map

Uses:
  - NodeJS
  - Socket.io
  - Bootstrap
  - gmaps.js
  - geoip-lite


The intent is to use this to display realtime geolocated events. In this case, I'm using geoip to translate currently random IP addresses into GPS coordinates to render on a Google Map. This could be used for any number of things.
